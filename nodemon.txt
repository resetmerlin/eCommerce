Now, Nodemon is a tool that we can use to constantly watch our server so that we don't have to keep

resetting it because we don't use something like Nodemon.

I mean, there's other things you can use as well.

But if we don't use anything, then every time we make a change to, you know, server, we have

to keep restarting the server.

So to use node one, we're going to go into our packages and create a script right here.

So we have our START script, which runs the back end server file.

Now I'm going to add another script called Server.



However, we don't want to run npm start from the route.

We need to run it from the front end folder.

So the way we can do that is we can add a dash dash prefix and then the name of the folder front end.

So essentially it's going to go into the front end folder first and then run npm start.

1. ex:     "client": "npm start --prefix fronted"
