The throw statement allows you to create an exception 
or a custom error. The exception can be like a Javascript string,
 a number, a boolean, or an object. So, If you use this statement 
 together with the try…catch statement. It allows you to control 
 the flow of the program and generate accurate error messages. 
 For example: throw “too small” (throw a text),
  throw 500 (throw a number), etc.
